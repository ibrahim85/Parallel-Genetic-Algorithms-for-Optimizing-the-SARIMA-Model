# Evolve a SARIMA with a genetic algorithm

This is an example of how we can use a genetic algorithm in an attempt to find the optimal SARIMA parameters for prediction tasks.

On the NCDC dataset, we are able to quickly find the best SARIMA model. 

## To run

To run the brute force algorithm:

```python3 brute.py```

To run the genetic algorithm:

```python3 main.py```

You can set your SARIMA parameter choices by editing each of those files first. You can also choose whether to use the NCDC or other datasets.
